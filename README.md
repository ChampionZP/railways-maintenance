# Railways maintenance
Prognosis and maintenance policy for railways; track geometry prediction; defect prediction.
# Ensemble of degradation processes
For some special systems, there might be cretain time before which the systems behavior as the Wiener porcess but afte that degrade as a Gaussian process. How to intergrate multiple processes for a better description of the system degradation? 
# Change point detection
How to detect the change points based on the monitored data? Hereby, the decision variables are ${N; t_1, t_2,...,t_N}$, where $N$ is the number of change points, regrading to the number of degradation processes that are intergrated in the model, $t_1, t_2,...,t_N$ are the corresponding time points.
# System types
Consider a system type parameter $\beta$ to describe different systems within the same modeling framework, for example, there are four types of tracks in the Track Degradation (2015) dataset, each type corresponds to one segment on the track. The parameter $\beta$ describes the differences of degradation rate between different systems. One practical motivation can be that the systems are working in different conditions.
# Imperfect repair and MDP/RL for maintenance
Policy gradient can be developed for optimizating the repair level in a continues space, e.g., [0, 1]; 
# Interval prediction/estimation
Compared with point estimates, interval estimate considers the uncretainty.
